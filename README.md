# encrypt-decrypt

Based on a school assignment that I edited to be more user-friendly. Uses the xxtea/btea algorithm to encrypt/decrypt. Mainly meant for testing purposes.

All but EncryptionTool are supposed to be commandline executables. Keygen expects a single argument, the name of the file you want to generate the key in. Decrypt and encrypt both take three arguments, in this order: inputfile, keyfile, outputfile. The EncryptionTool.exe is more user-friendly to use.
